iOS piano application for iPhone and iPad

This is a project that I started a while back and never got time to finish. Decided to
open source the project so it does not sit and just go to waste.

Big thanks to Craig Wilson at http://wilsonics.com for creating the piano samples.


Things I would like to do:
===========================
- Finish the game engine so it can be used to help teach folks to read music
- Add a mesh transport that would allow anybody on the Lan to have a jam session with
everyone else on the Lan
